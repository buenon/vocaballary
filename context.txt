- TypeScript ~5.8.3
- Vite ^7.1.2
- ESLint (typescript-eslint)
- Node v24.7.0 (from .nvmrc)
- Yarn 4.9.4 (packageManager)

Repo State
- Template: React + TypeScript + Vite starter
- No game code yet (planning only)

Out of Scope (for now)
- Analytics/telemetry
- Monetization (ads/IAP)
- Advanced accessibility features

Open TBDs (tracked for planning; not to include in README)
- Final word lists and image asset sources/licensing
- Initial category set at launch
- Detailed animation/physics parameters
- Voice-over sourcing (recordings vs TTS)
- Visual design system (palette, fonts, logo)

Assets (OpenMoji Hybrid Strategy)
- Source: OpenMoji Color SVG pack (~4k SVGs)
- License: CC BY-SA 4.0 (attribution + share-alike on modifications)
- Strategy: Hybrid
  - Keep full vendor pack untouched at vendor/openmoji/
  - Curated subset copied to public/assets/svg/<category>/<slug>.svg with friendly names
  - Manifest JSON maps word → unicode → category → paths → aliases
- Scope: Target 2,000 kid-friendly nouns for v1
- Categories (initial): Animals; Food & Drinks; Fruits & Vegetables; Household Items; School & Learning; Toys & Games; Clothing & Accessories; Nature & Plants; Weather; Vehicles & Transportation; Places & Buildings; Electronics & Tools; Colors & Shapes; Body Parts
- Normalization: Ensure consistent viewBox; remove width/height; SVGO optimize; neutral variant when multiples exist (e.g., skin tones)
- Deliverables: Curated folders; manifest; coverage report (missing words/suggested alternates); preview sheets for QA
- Attribution: Include OpenMoji credit in README and in-app (About/Settings)

Asset Pipeline TODOs
- Plan OpenMoji hybrid asset pipeline and folder structure [pending]
- Define category mapping and word selection guidelines [pending]
- Curate 2K kid-friendly nouns from OpenMoji metadata [pending]
- Build manifest mapping word→unicode→category→paths [pending]
- Prepare vendor pack and curated subset with friendly names [pending]
- Normalize/optimize SVGs (viewBox, SVGO) with QA checks [pending]
- Produce coverage report and preview sheets for QA [pending]
- Add attribution and licensing docs/screens for OpenMoji [pending]

Assets — Detailed Hybrid Plan (OpenMoji)
- Vendor location: vendor/openmoji/ (keep original ZIP contents and LICENSE/ATTRIBUTION)
- Curated location: public/assets/svg/<category>/<slug>.svg (friendly names)
- Manifest schema (JSON):
  {
    word: string,              // primary display word (lowercase)
    aliases: string[],         // synonyms/alternate names
    category: string,          // one of our categories
    unicode: string,           // OpenMoji codepoint(s), e.g., "1F431"
    source: "openmoji",       
    vendorPath: string,        // path in vendor/openmoji
    assetPath: string          // path in public/assets/svg/... (curated)
  }
- Naming rules (slugs):
  - Lowercase, ASCII, hyphen-separated; strip punctuation/diacritics
  - Prefer singular nouns (cat, apple, shoe)
  - On collisions, append "-u<unicode>" (e.g., "apple-u1F34E")
  - Prefer neutral variants (no skin tone/gender unless the word requires it)
- SVG normalization (when we implement):
  - Preserve original in vendor; curated copies may be optimized
  - Ensure viewBox is present; remove width/height attributes; SVGO optimize with conservative plugins; no visual/style changes
- Attribution & license handling:
  - OpenMoji is CC BY-SA 4.0: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/
  - Required credit: "Emoji artworks from OpenMoji – the open-source emoji and icon project. License: CC BY-SA 4.0" with link to https://openmoji.org
  - Add attribution in README and an in-app About/Settings screen
  - Include OpenMoji LICENSE and attribution file in vendor/openmoji/
  - ShareAlike consideration: our curated copies may count as derivatives; distribute derivative SVGs under CC BY-SA 4.0; keep originals intact

Word selection guidelines (replaces exclusions)
- Include: concrete, common, kid-friendly nouns seen in daily life (animals, foods, household/school objects, places, vehicles, simple weather, body parts, colors/shapes)
- Exclude: abstract symbols, flags, UI icons, gestures/skin-tone/gender variants, adult/unsafe items, cultural/religious symbols, redundant variants, complex emotion faces
- Keep nouns simple and singular; prefer the most generic variant

Category Mapping (rules)
- Animals: OpenMoji group/subgroup containing animals; include pets, farm, wild, sea, birds, insects (rename to kid-friendly nouns)
- Food & Drinks: food/dish/beverage that are not fruits/vegetables (e.g., pizza, bread, milk)
- Fruits & Vegetables: items tagged fruit/vegetable; keep distinct from prepared foods
- Household Items: furniture, appliances, kitchen tools, cleaning items, bathroom objects
- School & Learning: books, stationery (pencil, pen, ruler), backpack, globe, microscope, chalkboard
- Toys & Games: toys, board games, blocks, kite, ball (avoid gambling items)
- Clothing & Accessories: shirts, pants, shoes, hat, backpack, glasses
- Nature & Plants: tree, leaf, flower, plant, rock, mountain, sun, moon (exclude weather-specific icons here)
- Weather: cloud, rain, snow, thunder, rainbow, thermometer (weather context)
- Vehicles & Transportation: car, bus, train, bicycle, airplane, boat, rocket (keep rocket if desired as vehicle)
- Places & Buildings: house, school, hospital, store, park, bridge, castle
- Electronics & Tools: phone, tablet, computer, camera, light bulb, hammer, wrench, screwdriver
- Colors & Shapes: geometric shapes (square, circle, triangle) and color swatches (red circle, blue square) mapped to color words
- Body Parts: eye, ear, nose, mouth, hand, foot, leg, arm (avoid specific gestures)

Curation Strategy (2,000 targets)
- Start with high-frequency noun lists for ages 6–10; map to OpenMoji names/tags
- Prefer concrete, tangible objects seen in everyday life
- Balance categories for coverage (e.g., 10–20% animals, 10–15% food, etc.)
- Record misses (no good emoji match) in coverage report with suggested alternates

QA Aids (deliver later)
- coverage.json: selected, missing
- manifest.json: final curated mapping
- preview-grid.pdf/png: small tiles by category for quick review

Next planning step
- Define the initial shortlist per category (top 2,000 nouns) using OpenMoji metadata and kid-frequency lists; no fetching yet

Manifest (compact keys reference)
- w: word (singular, lowercase)
- c: category (one of 14 categories)
- u: unicode codepoint(s), e.g., "1F34E"
- p: asset path under public/assets/svg/<category>/<slug>.svg
